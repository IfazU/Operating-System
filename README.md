Overview

Pintos is a simple instructional operating system framework that supports basic OS features like process management, threading and user program execution. It is written in C.

The project involves enhancing the existing Pintos system to introduce features like concurrency, synchronization, and the ability to run user programs in a controlled environment.

Features

Multithreading and Concurrency: Support for concurrent execution using kernel-level threads with synchronization mechanisms such as locks, semaphores, and condition variables.
User Program Support: Allows for the loading and execution of user programs within the Pintos operating system. This involves implementing system calls and memory management.
File System: Provides a simple file system interface that supports basic file operations.
Process Management: Supports process creation, execution, and termination with proper resource management.
Synchronization Primitives: Implements locks, semaphores, and condition variables to handle synchronization between threads and processes.
